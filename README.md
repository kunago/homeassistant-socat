# Home Assistant with socat for remote zwave
Based on [homeassistant/home-assistant](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant/) image, [published on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kunago/homeassistant-socat/).
Please [report issues on github](https://github.com/kunago/homeassistant-socat/issues).
Instead of using a locally-connected zwave device (usb stick/etc), we can use a serial device mapped over the network with ser2net and then map it to a local zwave serial device with socat.
This docker container ensures that
 - a zwave device is mapped in the local docker with socat
 - home assistant is running
If there are any failures, both socat and home assistant will be restarted.

# Environment options:
All  [homeassistant-home-assistant](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant/) image options are available and on top of that a few others have been added:

**PAUSE_BETWEEN_CHECKS**=2 (In seconds, how much time to wait between checking running processes; Default: 2)

**LOG_TARGET**=/log.log (Path to log file. Ommit to write logs to stdout; Default: stdout)

**SOCAT_ZWAVE_TYPE**="tcp"

**SOCAT_ZWAVE_HOST**="192.168.5.5"

**SOCAT_ZWAVE_PORT**="7676" (Where socat should connect to - will be used as tcp://192.168.5.5:7676)

**SOCAT_ZWAVE_LINK**="/dev/zwave" (What the zwave device should be mapped to. Use this in your home assistant configuration file.)
